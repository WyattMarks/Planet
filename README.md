# Planet
Gravity Simulator

This small project is a gravity simulator. You can spawn "planets" which are attracted to other planets. You can see cool patterns emerge when you get two planets orbiting each other. There are a lot of small features, such as 'static' planets, larger planets, etc. I would call this project complete, I only did it for fun.
